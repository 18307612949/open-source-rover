# Replacement Top and Bottom Plates

## The Need for Replacement Plates
The 12x9 aluminum pattern plates specified in other parts of the rover documentation have been discontinued by ServoCity. The included *top\_plate\_baseline.dxf* and *bottom\_plate\_baseline.dxf* can serve as replacements.

These plates are the same size as the originals, so everything else is the same except for items noted below.

## Cutting the Plates
The plates should be laser-cut using 1/4" or 5- to 6-mm plywood or MDF. Acrylic is likely to be too brittle for this purpose. Online services such as Sculpteo can do the laser cutting if needed.

## Installing the Plates - Changes to Screw Lengths
The laser cut replacements are approximately 1/8" thicker than the original aluminum plates, so all screw sizes need to be increased by 1/8" to compensate.

* Use 3/8" screws (B2) instead of 1/4" screws (B1) to attach the plates to the side mounts, 
* Use 1.25" screws (B7) instead of the 1" screws (B6) when assembling the [differential pivot block](../differential_pivot/README.md>). 

**Use #6 washers (W1) with the 3/8" screws when attaching the side mounts to prevent the screws from digging into the plywood or MDF.**

## Notes
* *front\_plate.DXF* and *back_plate.DXF* can be cut from the same material as the top and bottom plates if desired. These plates should remain as 1/8" or 3 mm thick.
* The holes to mount the head have beem moved forward slightly to allow for additional clearance between the head and the PCB.
